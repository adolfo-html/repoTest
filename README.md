# Official Website Project

Hi people, this is a website I plan on working on frequently.

Goals I want to achieve from doing this:

- Learn to complete projects
- Learn how to make a fully functional website (even if it's not that useful)
- Learn how to authenticate myself locally in Git in my directories so VSCode can stop asking me to "make sure you've authenticated your user.email and stuff"
- Make something cool

Another thing... I know it's weird, but I really want to be able to complete giant programming projects by myself. ESPECIALLY websites, because it's "basic", but challenging if you want to put effort into it, I think. Anyway, you're probably thinking "why would you make all these repositories public if you're not gonna collab with people". Well that's because I have goals for myself. Is it wrong to want to be a person with expertise you can show? It's less about flexing and more about proving to myself that I can do it. So there's a little bit about me.
